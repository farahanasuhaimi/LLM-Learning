# House Price Prediction Project: Step 1

This project demonstrates a basic end-to-end workflow for building a house price prediction model using a real-world dataset. It covers data loading, feature selection, handling categorical variables, model training, and evaluation.

## 1. Project Strategy and Steps

Our approach to building this house price prediction model followed these key steps:

1.  **Data Acquisition**: Obtained the `train.csv` dataset from the Kaggle "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" competition.
2.  **Data Loading**: Loaded the `train.csv` file into a pandas DataFrame.
3.  **Feature Selection & Preparation**: Identified relevant features (`LotArea`, `TotRmsAbvGrd`, `Neighborhood`) and the target variable (`SalePrice`). Crucially, we performed **One-Hot Encoding** on the `Neighborhood` categorical feature to convert it into a numerical format suitable for the model.
4.  **Data Splitting**: Divided the dataset into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test) to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
5.  **Model Training**: Initialized and trained a `LinearRegression` model using the prepared training data.
6.  **Prediction**: Used the trained model to make predictions on the test set.
7.  **Model Evaluation**: Assessed the model's performance using various regression metrics (MSE, RMSE, R-squared).

## 2. Types of Features to Consider in House Price Prediction

House prices are influenced by a multitude of factors. Beyond the basic `LotArea` and `TotRmsAbvGrd`, here are broader categories of features often considered:

*   **Numerical Features**:
    *   **Area-related**: `GrLivArea` (Above grade living area), `TotalBsmtSF` (Total basement area), `1stFlrSF` (First floor area), `GarageArea` (Size of garage in square feet).
    *   **Count-related**: `FullBath` (Full bathrooms), `HalfBath` (Half bathrooms), `BedroomAbvGr` (Bedrooms above grade), `GarageCars` (Size of garage in car capacity).
    *   **Age-related**: `YearBuilt` (Original construction date), `YearRemodAdd` (Remodel date).
    *   **Other**: `Fireplaces`, `PoolArea`, `MiscVal`.

*   **Categorical Features**:
    *   **Location**: `Neighborhood` (as used in this project), `MSZoning` (General zoning classification).
    *   **Property Characteristics**: `HouseStyle` (Style of dwelling), `BldgType` (Type of dwelling), `Foundation`, `RoofStyle`, `Exterior1st`, `Exterior2nd`, `MasVnrType` (Masonry veneer type).
    *   **Quality/Condition**: `OverallQual` (Overall material and finish quality), `OverallCond` (Overall condition rating), `ExterQual` (Exterior material quality), `KitchenQual` (Kitchen quality).
    *   **Utilities/Amenities**: `HeatingQC` (Heating quality and condition), `CentralAir`, `GarageType`, `PavedDrive`.

*   **Ordinal Features**: These are categorical features with an inherent order (e.g., 'Excellent' > 'Good' > 'Average'). While they can be one-hot encoded, sometimes they are mapped to numerical values directly to preserve the order.

*   **Derived Features (Feature Engineering)**: Creating new features from existing ones (e.g., `AgeOfHouse = current_year - YearBuilt`, `TotalSF = GrLivArea + TotalBsmtSF`).

## 3. Handling Categorical Features

Categorical features (like `Neighborhood`) must be converted into a numerical format before they can be used by most machine learning models. Choosing the right method is crucial as it can impact model performance. Here are several common techniques:

| Method | How It Works | Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **One-Hot Encoding** | Creates a new binary (0 or 1) column for each unique category in the original feature. | Avoids creating a false sense of order between categories. Easy to understand and implement. | Can lead to a very high number of features (the "curse of dimensionality") if the original feature has many categories. |
| **Label Encoding** | Assigns a unique integer to each category (e.g., 'NeighborhoodA' -> 0, 'NeighborhoodB' -> 1). | Simple and requires no new features. | Creates an arbitrary order (e.g., 2 > 1) that can mislead models like linear regression into thinking there's a ranking. |
| **Dummy Coding** | Creates `k-1` new binary columns for `k` categories. One category is chosen as the "baseline" and is represented by all zeros. | Avoids multicollinearity, which is important for some statistical models. | The interpretation of the coefficients becomes relative to the baseline category. |
| **Target Encoding** | Replaces each category with the average value of the target variable for that category (e.g., replace 'NeighborhoodA' with the mean `SalePrice` for all houses in NeighborhoodA). | Can be highly predictive as it directly uses information from the target. Doesn't increase feature count. | High risk of overfitting, especially with rare categories. Requires careful implementation to prevent data leakage from the test set. |
| **Hashing Encoder** | Uses a hash function to convert categories into a fixed, smaller number of numerical features. | Memory efficient and fast, especially for features with thousands of categories (high cardinality). | Hash collisions (different categories mapped to the same value) can cause information loss. The resulting features are not interpretable. |

In this project, we used **One-Hot Encoding** as it is a safe and effective default choice for a feature like `Neighborhood` which doesn't have too many unique categories.

## 4. Regression Model Evaluation Metrics

To assess how well a regression model performs, we use various metrics. Each provides a different perspective on the model's error and fit:

*   **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:
    *   **Formula**: Average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values.
    *   **Interpretation**: Penalizes larger errors more heavily. The unit is the square of the target variable's unit, making it less intuitive.

*   **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**:
    *   **Formula**: Square root of MSE.
    *   **Interpretation**: In the same unit as the target variable, making it highly interpretable. Represents the typical magnitude of the prediction errors.

*   **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**:
    *   **Formula**: Average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values.
    *   **Interpretation**: Also in the same unit as the target variable. Less sensitive to outliers than RMSE, providing a more linear average error.

*   **R-squared ($R^2$) Score (Coefficient of Determination)**:
    *   **Formula**: Measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable predictable from the independent variables.
    *   **Interpretation**: Ranges from 0 to 1 (can be negative). A value of 1 means perfect prediction, 0 means no better than predicting the mean. A negative value means the model is worse than predicting the mean.

*   **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**:
    *   **Formula**: Average of the absolute percentage errors.
    *   **Interpretation**: Expresses error as a percentage of the actual value, intuitive for business contexts. Sensitive to zero or near-zero actual values.

## 5. Other Regression Models

While Linear Regression is a fundamental starting point, many other algorithms can be used for regression tasks, often offering better performance for complex datasets:

*   **Polynomial Regression**: An extension of linear regression that models the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable as an nth degree polynomial.
*   **Ridge Regression / Lasso Regression**: Regularized versions of linear regression that help prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the model's coefficients.
*   **Decision Tree Regressor**: A non-linear model that splits the data into branches based on feature values, eventually leading to a predicted value.
*   **Random Forest Regressor**: An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
*   **Gradient Boosting Regressors (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)**: Powerful ensemble techniques that build trees sequentially, with each new tree correcting errors made by previous ones. Often achieve state-of-the-art results.
*   **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)**: An extension of Support Vector Machines for regression, aiming to find a hyperplane that best fits the data points within a certain margin.
*   **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor**: A non-parametric method that predicts the value of a new data point based on the average of its k-nearest neighbors in the training data.

This project serves as a foundational step. As you progress through the learning roadmap, you will explore more advanced techniques and models to tackle complex prediction tasks more effectively.
