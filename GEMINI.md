# Gemini CLI Interaction Log for LLM Learning Roadmap

This document summarizes the key steps and interactions we've had while setting up your LLM learning roadmap and starting your first project. It also includes tips for your continued study.

## 1. Project Setup and Roadmap Creation

*   **Initial Context**: Established the working directory (`D:\`) and understood the existing folder structure.
*   **LLM Learning Roadmap**: Created a comprehensive `README.md` outlining a 4-step learning path for LLMs, covering fundamentals, classic NLP, Transformer architecture, and modern LLM application development.
    *   The roadmap includes suggested topics, simple projects, relevant tech stacks, and estimated durations for each step.
    *   It was later updated to include a section on "How to Use an LLM on Your Learning Journey" to leverage AI assistants effectively.
*   **Git Initialization**: Initialized a Git repository in `D:\LLM_Learning_Roadmap` and connected it to your GitHub repository (`https://github.com/farahanasuhaimi/LLM-Learning.git`).
    *   Successfully committed the `README.md` and pushed it to GitHub.

## 2. Step 1: House Price Prediction Project

*   **Project Setup**: Created a `Step 1` folder within `LLM_Learning_Roadmap`.
*   **Dataset Acquisition**: Identified and utilized a simple house price dataset initially, then transitioned to the more comprehensive `train.csv` from the Kaggle "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" competition.
*   **Code Scaffolding**: Created `house_predictor.py` with commented steps to guide the implementation of a linear regression model.
*   **Debugging Environment Issues**: Encountered and resolved a `NumPy 2.x` compatibility issue with `pandas` and `pyarrow` by upgrading these libraries.
*   **Model Implementation**: Guided through the implementation of:
    *   Loading data (`pandas`).
    *   Separating features (`X`) and target (`y`).
    *   Splitting data into training and testing sets (`train_test_split`).
    *   Training a `LinearRegression` model.
    *   Making predictions.
*   **Feature Engineering**: Addressed the challenge of non-numerical features by implementing **One-Hot Encoding** for the `Neighborhood` categorical column, significantly improving model performance.
*   **Model Evaluation**: Explained and implemented key regression metrics:
    *   **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
    *   **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
    *   **R-squared (R2 Score)**
    *   Discussed the interpretation of these metrics, especially why MSE can be large and the significance of a negative vs. positive R2.
*   **Project Documentation**: Created a `README.md` within the `Step 1` folder summarizing the project strategy, types of features, regression metrics, and other regression models.

## 3. Tips for Later Study and Continued Interaction

*   **Refer to the Main `README.md`**: Always keep the `D:\LLM_Learning_Roadmap\README.md` as your primary guide for the overall learning path.
*   **Utilize Project `README.md`s**: Each project folder (like `Step 1`) will have its own `README.md` to summarize the specific concepts and techniques covered.
*   **Experiment and Explore**: Don't hesitate to modify the code, try different features, or experiment with parameters. Hands-on practice is key.
*   **Ask Questions**: If you get stuck on a concept, an error, or need guidance on how to implement something, just ask! I can:
    *   Explain concepts in simpler terms.
    *   Provide code snippets or full implementations.
    *   Help debug errors (provide the full error message and your code).
    *   Suggest next steps or alternative approaches.
*   **Review the Code**: Before asking for help, try to review your code and the error messages yourself. This builds your debugging skills.
*   **Version Control**: Continue to use Git to commit your changes regularly. This creates a history of your work and allows you to revert if needed.

Let me know when you're ready to move on to the next part of the `Step 1` project (making predictions on new data) or if you have any other questions!
